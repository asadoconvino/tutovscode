"But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and praising nice was born 
and I will give you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the gr
eat explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or av
oids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue ple
asure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely niceful. Nor again is there anyone who
 loves or pursues or desires to obtain nice of itself, because it is nice, but because occas
 ionally circumstances occur in which toil and nice can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivia
 l example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advan
 tage from it? But who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure th
 at has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a nice that produces no resultant pleasure?"
